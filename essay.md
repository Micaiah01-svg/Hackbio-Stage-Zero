**Why Personalized Medicine Isn't Just Hype But Still Isn't Routine**

Personalized medicine isn't just a buzzword-it's already changing how we understand and treat disease. By tailoring therapy to an individual's genetic profile, environment, and lifestyle, clinicians are shifting from a "one size fits all" approach to one of precision and insight.

For example, therapies such as trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer demonstrate tangible benefits when treatment is matched to molecular markers (Piccart-Gebhart et al., 2005). Pharmacogenetic screening, like checking HLA-B\*57:01 before prescribing abacavir, prevents life-threatening reactions, showing how genomics is saving lives today (Phillips et al., 2018). At the system level, the UK's 100,000 Genomes Project has helped embed whole-genome sequencing into the National Health Service (NHS) workflows-about one in four participants with rare disease received a new diagnosis through the initiative (Genomics England, 2018).

Bioinformatics is the engine powering this transformation. With over 3 billion base pairs in the human genome, only computational tools can make sense of how variants link to disease, drug response and patient outcomes. Led by national efforts in the UK, Estonia and Singapore, genomics programs show how large-scale data, secure platforms and interpretive pipelines can bring personalized medicine into practice (Genomics England, 2022; OECD, 2019).

So why isn't personalized medicine yet routine across all health systems? Three major bottlenecks remain:

- **Accessibility**: Genomic sequencing and analysis remain too costly or unavailable in many regions.
- **Infrastructure & Data Governance**: Many healthcare systems lack robust pipelines for storing, sharing and interpreting genomic and clinical data.
- **Workforce Readiness**: Clinicians trained before the genomics era often lack the confidence and tools needed to interpret and act on genetic information.

In short, personalized medicine is real, impactful and growing-in practice and study. It's not hype anymore. But to make it routine we need more than technology: we need global access, system redesign and clinically trained teams ready to interpret genomic data. The science is ready; the challenge now lies in scaling and integrating it.
